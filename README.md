# TCP Chat + Tic-Tac-Toe Game  

A multiclient TCP chat server written in C# with an integrated Tic-Tac-Toe game. This project demonstrates asynchronous socket-based networking, database persistence for player scores, and a synchronized multiplayer game experience ‚Äî all within a Windows Forms UI.  

## üöÄ Features  

- **Multiplayer Chat System**  
  - Host or join a TCP chat server on a specified port.  
  - Multiple clients with unique usernames and passwords.  
  - Private messaging with `!whisper`.  
  - Moderator system with `!kick` functionality.  
  - Rich command list for both chat and game control.  

- **Tic-Tac-Toe Game Integration**  
  - Play Tic-Tac-Toe directly in the client form.  
  - Board updates synchronized in real-time between players.  
  - Game state stored in a persistent SQLite database.  
  - Automatic win/loss/draw tracking.  
  - Colour-coded board state (violet = active game, grey = inactive).  

- **Score Tracking**  
  - `!scores` command displays all players‚Äô wins, losses, and draws.  
  - Scores are sorted from highest wins to lowest.
